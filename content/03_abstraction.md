> [!NOTE] Yoda Teaching Grogu about Abstraction!
> **Grogu:** “Master Yoda, how does this code work?”  
**Yoda:** “What it does, you must know. How it does it, _unlearn that curiosity_ you must.”  
**Grogu:** “So… abstraction?”  
**Yoda:** “Yes. Open the box you will not. Debug forever, you will if you do.”

Greetings `Grogu`,

I feel this concept is so important that it can be used in any circumstance in your life. Using it will make your life so better that you will tackle big problem statements and its solutions with ease. 

## What is Abstraction?

![[full-abstraction.excalidraw.svg]]

**Explaining the Figure!**

You have Nand Gate and using that you build different logic gates. Now this logic gates, you can forget its implementation and using the logic gates, duplicating them we can build RAM, ALU, and more. And after we build ALU, RAM, we can forget its implementation and use it to build a complete CPU, Computer. This is the way!

Abstraction is in crux is **Don't worry about the "How" it does (Its implementation)?, Just worry about the "What" it does.**

The cognitive ability to "divide and conquer" a complex system into manageable modules is empowered by yet another cognitive gift: our ability to discern between the *abstraction* and the *implementation* of each module.

> [!NOTE] Abstraction in Computer Science
> In computer science, we take these words concretely: abstraction describes what the module does, and implementation describes how it does it.


This is the concept of Abstraction.

With this concept, you can now recalibrate your previous project and use this ideology to implement it again and you will see the ease of creating modules and making a organized solution for your problems.

See you next time, 
Mrunal.
