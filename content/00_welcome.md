Greetings `Grogu`, (Yes! you.)

I am Mrunal Nirajkumar Shah ([@mrunalnshah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrunalnshah/)). This is learning pathway for algorithms and data structure. 

#### Why this course?
I believe there are very good courses on data structures and algorithms out there. Even highly intuitive and with better visual appearance. But what I feel is they lack detailed intuitions and depth of topic (for staying simple). That's what I will be doing different in this learning path. Keeping it simple while digging the depth of the topic.

Not everyone learns better from a particular resource. This may or may not work for you. So don't force yourself if you don't understand my explanation. Someone out there will be always better than me for you. *What matter is that you learn.*

***Learning is for everyone.***

May god show his path for us.

Thank you,  
Mrunal.
